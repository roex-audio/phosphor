# Phosphor

A spectrogram-based audio synthesis tool for macOS. Paint images that become sound.

Phosphor lets you draw directly on a spectrogram canvas -- the X-axis is time, the Y-axis is frequency, and brightness controls volume. Import any image and hear what it sounds like, or paint spectral sounds from scratch using a variety of tools and timbres.
